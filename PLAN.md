## Three Contributions

1. **C1 - Methodology:** A replicable pipeline for digitizing legislation in countries without open data APIs (scraping + OCR + Markdown + Git)

2. **C2 - Implementation:** An open-source platform (legalize-pe) with web app, REST API (9 endpoints), and offline-capable PWA

3. **C3 - Evaluation:** Empirical comparison showing improvements over Peru's existing system (SPIJ)

## Paper Outline

| # | Section | Pages | Content |
|---|---------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Introduction | 1 | Problem: Peru has 200k+ laws, no API, PDFs/photos. Access to justice crisis in Global South. State contributions. |
| 2 | Background / Related Work | 1-1.5 | legalize-es (Spain), Free Law Project (US), legislation.gov.uk (UK), Akoma Ntoso (OASIS standard). Git for versioning concept. |
| 3 | The Peruvian Legal Access Problem | 1 | SPIJ critique, no API, regional laws unpublished in El Peruano, data hostility, 200k+ norms inaccessible. |
| 4 | Methodology / Approach | 2 | Pipeline: scraping (agent-browser, SPIJ) → OCR (Tesseract) → Markdown + frontmatter → Git (commits = reforms) → Database (Turso) → REST API → PWA. Architecture diagram. |
| 5 | Implementation: Legalize-PE | 1.5 | Tech stack at the time (Astro, Next.js, Drizzle, Turso), 119 laws then, 9 API endpoints, offline PWA, open source repo. Screenshots. |
| 6 | Preliminary Results | 1 | Comparison table: SPIJ vs legalize-pe (5 metrics). Lighthouse scores. |
| 7 | Discussion & Future Work | 0.5-1 | Limitations (119/200k laws), scaling plan, regional expansion, replicability for other Global South countries. |
| 8 | Conclusion | 0.5 | Summary of contributions, call to action for open legal infrastructure. |
| - | References | ~1 | 20-30 citations |

## Comparison Metrics to Collect

| # | Metric | SPIJ | Legalize-PE | How to Measure |
|---|--------|------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | Page load time | ? sec | ? ms | Chrome DevTools, Lighthouse |
| 2 | Search response time | ? sec | ? ms | Time to find "Código Civil" |
| 3 | API availability | 0 endpoints | 9 endpoints | Document features |
| 4 | Offline capability | No | Yes (PWA) | Test in airplane mode |
| 5 | Lighthouse scores | ? | ? | Performance, Accessibility, PWA |

---

## PWA Requirements

- [ ] Service worker for offline caching
- [ ] Cache the then-current 119 laws for offline reading
- [ ] Installable (manifest.json)
- [ ] Works without internet connection
- [ ] Sync new laws when online

---

## Differentiation from Legalize-ES

| Aspect | Legalize-ES (Spain) | Legalize-PE (Peru) |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Data source | BOE official API (easy) | Scraping + OCR (hard) |
| Web app | None | Full Astro site |
| REST API | None | 9 endpoints |
| Database | None (Git only) | Turso + Drizzle |
| OCR | Not needed | Tesseract |
| PWA/Offline | No | Yes |

**Key message:** Spain had a government API. Peru has PDFs and photos. We solved the harder problem.

**Citation:** Acknowledge legalize-es as inspiration for "Git = legislation versioning" concept.

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| PWA takes longer than expected | Medium | Start Day 5, have 2 days buffer. Minimum viable = offline cache only. |
| Can't find enough citations | Low | Use Google Scholar, ACM DL, related work sections of similar papers. |
| Page count too long/short | Medium | Adjust Discussion section. Add/remove screenshots. |
| SPIJ blocks scraping during metrics | Low | Use cached data, screenshots as evidence. |
| Submission system issues | Low | Submit Day 10 evening, have full Day 11 as buffer. |
